**ATTENTION** </br>
I need to follow the problem statement. WRITE THE PROBLEM STATEMENT HERE AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON FOR THE SPECIALISED MODULE. </br>
**ATTENTION** </br>


**Notes to improve:** 
1) The code is too hard coded, there are no foreign keys, the ids should be added or deleted dynamically. 
2) Focus on one thing at a time, I am all over the place and getting done very little. Follow the following to do list in the order.

**Here are to do list so far:**

1) Habit tracker table -> with small highlighting journal like 'I got job on this day'
2) Journal -> can show option or tick saying it contains journal on that day
3) To do list  
4) Bucket list
5) What I want my life to be in next 1-5-10 years and I want it to remind me after that selected certain period of time (give option for them to choose time, dont choose on your own)
6) What I am grateful for 
7) A chart of showing amount of todolist/Habit logs completed or not;  -> quickchart(This ones perhaps unnecessarily difficult, is it even worth it) ??. I could just do a simple table graph instead if its too difficult.
8) Create a home page which is accesible to everone where they have option to view the DEMO, like how professionally the legit bussiness do. 
9) what are the things that are holding me back like insecurities, circumstances. What could be done about it. If possible add this feature somewhere in habit table or somewhere where it is engaged more.
10) Challenges. My challenges and Discover challenges.

**Not necessary but I could also add:**
1) PHP CS FIXER
2) DOCKER
3) I could check when I feel certain emotion. for eg: I feel depressed everytime I work from home and I have got days offs. While netural emotion everytime I go to the office. When I right click on certain emotion option in the table, it should give an option to track when I feel this emotion.
